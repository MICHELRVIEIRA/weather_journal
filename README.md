# Weather-Journal App Project

## Description

The project requires the user to enter a country's zip-code and the application returns the current day's temperature. In addition, the user enters how they are feeling on the date and this information is stored on the server and then included in the UI.

## Objective

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the server.js file and the website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use style.css to style your application to customized perfection.
